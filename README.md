# Advent of Code 2020

## Introduction
Advent of code is a coding challenge where two challenges are released each day. The first one, often easily than the second, gives you one start and the let you try the second challenge. After the 25 days of Advent, you should have earned 50 stars.
You can get all the information about the Advent of Code 2020 in their web [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com).

## Repo structure
All the solutions for the Advent of Code 2020 have been implemented at Java language using Eclipse. At root directory you will find the adventofcode2020 folder, who contains all the project. Inside, there are two interesting folders: src, who contains a folder for each day challenges and the test-cases folder, who contains the txt files with the problem-puzzles and the short examples.
Also, inside the days challenges folder, you will find a readme with the challenges description. Because of time and the increasing difficulty of the challenges, I haven’t uploaded all the challenges, but I will try to finish them (some day).
In this readme file you will find a links to each day folder and a summary with the kind of algorithms or data structures implemented, for example, arrays, binary trees, recursion…

## Index of challenges

### Day 1: Report Repair
- [Day 1](https://github.com/jcrucesadrados/adventofcode2020/tree/master/adventofcode2020/src/day1) 
- *First challenge*: Given a collection of numbers, find the two entries that sum to 2020. \#Arrays \#BigO \#SearchOptimization
- *Second challenge*: Given the same collection, find the three entries that sum to 2020. For this case I implemented the solution with a secondary function, avoiding use recursion
- *Bonus Track*: What if we are looking n entries that sum to x? For this case I refactored the code and implemented the challenge2 with recursion
